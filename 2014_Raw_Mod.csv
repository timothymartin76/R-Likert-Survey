Everyone just seem so unhappy and uptight.  For example; The Google Company has a gym in their facility for their workers to relieve stress.  The Agency should work on activities and other services for employees to relieve stress since this is a very stressful environment to work at.  On top of following to the Call Center's strict policies we also need to provide outstanding customer service and satisfaction.,"I would like to see improvements with the Call Center Leave Requests and Sick Leave policy.

CB's come out so much their impact is lost. Now emails are coming out to switch it up but training does not have the same impact of the Sups (nor is there a team effort). Operations is not made aware of what is needed or coming down the pipeline until they read the email that is sent to everyone. Reviews are done so quickly even before it can be coached or before the email goes out to point out the coaching. Although everything overlaps, in order to increase communication, roles need to be defined and lines need to be drawn in order to set expectations and address accountability. We tried it one way, it’s time to try a new way and if it does not work - back to the drawing board to refine out work.

LITTLE  THINGS LIKE  HAVING A TRASH CAN AT OUR REACH OR WATER COOLERS CLOSER TO OUR STATIONS MEANS ALOT. VERY TROUBLED AS A VETERAN I  SEE HOW BAD THINGS HAVE GOTTEN HERE. AGAIN LET'S MOVE FORWARD AND HAVE THE CALLTAKER TRAINED TO HANDLE ALL CALLS. HAVE ALL FULL TIMERS WORK M-F. WEEKENDS SHOULD BE MOSTLY FILLED BY CUNY STUDENTS. ADEQUATE COVERAGE M-F WILL HANDLE TO OPEARATIONAL  NEEDS OF THE CALL CENTER .  NO MORE DETAILED DESCRITION. WE TALK TOO MUCH. EACH ANSWER TO A CONCERN SHOULD BE, ""i CAN HELP YOU WTIH THAT"".  PROBE TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEM, ASKS ONLY ON QUESTION TO FIND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND TAKE IT FROM THERE.   DEP, TO MANY QUESTIONS FOR A SEWER BACKUP. THE CALLER WILL DROWN IN THEIR BASEMENT AFTER THEY FINISHING ANSWERING ALL THE QUESTIONS REGARDING A SEWER BACKUP. GET THE LOCATION & we need to STOP GTRYING TO FIND OUT IF THIS IS A SEWER BACKUP   OR NOT. LET DEP ASKS ALL THOSE QUESTIONS.   WE ARE GOING  BACKWARD IF THESE INEEDS ARE NOT ADDRESSED.",

Communication between City Hall and 311. If the new Administration is amenable, establish a City Hall liaison to 311.     2.) If CCRs find it useful, more events where CCRs can interact with agency analysts, the Agency Relations and Content Support team, and the Content Managment team to discuss the existing content, how content's created and changed, and some of the challenges we face. There is an overview of CAR during New Hire training, but sessions after CCRs have been using the content for a while might be productive.  Of course, the issue is always finding time when CCRs can be scheduled for time off the phones without impacting Service Level.","Still wondering why the blinds are drawn.

Also, while I know this is a long shot, I would like an amendment to be made to the sick leave policy. This past January I had the flu, and ordinarily I would have gotten a doctor's note but because i don't have health insurance, I would have had to pay $50 for a visit, which was slightly less than a day's pay at the time. So I would like to request special treatment for someone who may not have health insurance and becomes ill (maybe like you get one pass without a doctor's note). These are just my opinions.

I understand time off is because of the needs of 311, however employees need to have a personal life, and need to plan vacations more than 90 days in advance. We are required here to request off only 90 days in advance. So we have to book a vacation, just to get denied even though we put it in 90 days? That is not fair, and this should be looked into. I believe the number one problem working at 311 is not having time off. We can't even get a day off to go to the doctors. This is a BIG issue.",,

How are they to determine if all probing questions were asked?","Work morale is horrioble. We still seeing people getting passed over for promotions.
